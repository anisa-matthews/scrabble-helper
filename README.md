# scrabble-helper
A program that produces all possible words given a collection of letters and a dictionary.

It produces all anagrams of a given set of letters that are valid words in the provided dictionary. For example, if the letters are

"recounts"

the program should print, in alphabetical order and one per line, all different words that can be made out of those letters (assuming that they are present in the dictionary that the program uses):

construe
counters
recounts

This was my second project for my Data Structures class, utilizing ArrayLists.
